# Fresh-Install-Windows-Setup-Guide
This guide is intended to help setup a fresh install of Windows. Basically a personal checklist but I will make it public so that other people can benefit from it as well.

# Obtain Windows to install

- Use [Windows Media Creation Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209) to get the latest iso straight from Microsoft and install it straight to your flashdrive.

# Updates

## Motherboard BIOS and Driver Updates

- Find your Motherboard Make and model and search for that plus 'drivers'. For example, with the motherboard 'ASRock X570 Steel Legend' you will search for 'ASRock X570 Steel Legend drivers' and look for a page owned by the manufacturer. Look for a 'support', 'drivers', 'bios and firmware' or something of the sort. For the above example the page would be this: https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-x570-e-gaming-model/helpdesk_bios

## Windows Updates

- [Windows] + [I] > Update & Security > Check for Updates

If your installation media was too far behind (If you used the 'Obtain Windows to install' section above it wont be.), updates can take a while. A good solution is to use [Windows Update Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) to update your computer. After you do it this way do the method above to make sure there are no smaller updates that need to be added.
